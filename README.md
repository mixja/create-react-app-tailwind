# Create React App with Tailwind CSS Support

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and adds [Tailwind CSS Support](https://tailwindcss.com/) with the following features:

- [PostCSS plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/#using-tailwind-with-postcss)
- [Purgecss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size#setting-up-purgecss) to minify production CSS bundle size
- Hot reloading support

The following packages have been added over and above the standard create-react-app packages:

- tailwindcss
- postcss-cli
- autoprefixer
- @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
- npm-run-all

## Configuration

You can configure Tailwind CSS as follows:

- [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) - [customize your Tailwind configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/)
- [`site/styles/site.css`](site/styles/site.css) - [add base styles to your CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-base-styles#using-css)

The generated Tailwind CSS is output to `site/styles/output.css` and should not be modified or included in source control.  The generated file is imported by `src/index.js`.

### Extending colors

You can extend the default Tailwind color palette by modifying the [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) file at the root of the project:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        blue: {
          react: '#61dafb',
        }
      }
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

This adds a color labelled `react` to Tailwinds blue color palette, which is used to color the React logo and link text:

```html
<svg className="app-logo fill-current text-blue-react" ...>
  ...
  ...
</svg>
```

```html
<a
  className="text-blue-react"
  href="https://reactjs.org"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  Learn React
</a>
```

### Add custom CSS

You can add custom CSS by modifying the [`src/styles/site.css`](src/styles/site.css) file.  The following shows custom CSS classes that apply the animation to the React logo.

```css
/* purgecss start ignore */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
/* purgecss end ignore */

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    .app-logo {
      animation: spin-360 infinite 20s linear;
    }
  }

@keyframes spin-360 {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
  }

@tailwind utilities;
```

Note that you should insert your custom CSS classes immediately **before** the `@tailwind utilities;` directive, which allows you to continue to apply Tailwind utility classes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run serve`

Runs the production app from the `build` folder generated by running `npm run build`.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
